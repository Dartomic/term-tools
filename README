README: Sean's config

1) Install patched ubuntu fonts
   Open ubuntu-font-family-0.80/
   using the file manager, open each of UbuntuMono-*-Powerline.ttf and click install

2) Install everything with ./install-all-config.sh
   or read it and run portions to selectively install portions

3) Add 'source ~/term-tools/bashrc.sh' to your bashrc
   (which already includes the autojump line -- no need to include it twice)
