== TERM TOOLS ==

This repository contains my terminal config and plugins for vim and tmux.

== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ==

0) Checkout term-tools:
    cd $HOME; git clone git://github.com/seanbell/term-tools.git

	If you want to install these elsewhere, you need to edit a bunch of places (sorry):
	~/term-tools/config/shrc.sh
	~/term-tools/install-all-config.sh
	~/term-tools/install-vim-config.sh

1) sudo apt-get install vim-nox

2) Install patched ubuntu fonts.  Open ubuntu-font-family-0.80/ using the file manager,
open each of UbuntuMono-*-Powerline.ttf and click install.

3) Backup and delete your ~/.vimrc, ~/.gvimrc, ~/.vim, and ~/.tmux.conf files.

4) Install everything with ./install-all-config.sh or read it and run portions to
selectively install portions.  Run with -f to overwrite any existing config you may have

5) Add 'source ~/term-tools/config/shrc.sh' to your bashrc (which already includes the
autojump line -- no need to include it twice)

6) Create a gnome terminal profile "solarized", run the installer in
gnome-terminal-colors-solarized, and then make "solarized" the default profile

7) Remap caps lock to escape -- open "keyboard layout" from the ubuntu menu (super key)
choose "options..." then "Caps lock key behavior".  Select "make caps lock an additional
escape"

7) This assumes that you check out the repository into ~/term-tools/.  If this is not the
case, edit ~/.tmux.conf and term-tools/config/bashrc.sh to point to the new path.

== USAGE ==

1) The vim commands are detailed in ~/.vimrc

2) For autojump, use the command "j" with a substring of the directly you want to visit
(that you have previously visited since installing these tools)
