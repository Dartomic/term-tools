== TERM TOOLS ==

This repository contains my vim and tmux configuration


== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ==

0) sudo apt-get install vim-nox

1) Install patched ubuntu fonts
   Open ubuntu-font-family-0.80/
   using the file manager, open each of UbuntuMono-*-Powerline.ttf and click install

2) Install everything with ./install-all-config.sh
   or read it and run portions to selectively install portions

3) Add 'source ~/term-tools/bashrc.sh' to your bashrc
   (which already includes the autojump line -- no need to include it twice)

4) Create a gnome terminal profile "solarized", run the installer in
   gnome-terminal-colors-solarized, and then make "solarized" the default profile

5) Remap caps lock to escape -- open "keyboard layout" from the ubuntu menu (super key)
   choose "options..." then "Caps lock key behavior".  Select "make caps lock an
   additional escape"
